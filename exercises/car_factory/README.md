##Feedback:

- Test setup was not working for me `require_relative` in place of 'require'
- This exercise difficulty is ok, every person trying to join Selleo should be able to do this.

Ruby: 2.1.3

```
rvm use 2.1.3@conundrum --create
gem install rspec
gem install require_all
rspec <insert path to your specs here>
```

Usual tasks:

- Write implementation so all tests are green
- Do not modify tests (sample implementation was written, so test are 99.99% ok and implementable)
